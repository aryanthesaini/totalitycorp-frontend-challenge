This project was made using NextJS

I started with creating a nextJs application, version 13 was new and I read the documentation to understand routing better.

I used tailwind CSS to start with the design of my web-application. Personally I find it very simple and powerful.

A lot of data for now is hard-coded but I want to add a backend to ensure the website is functional, hence the functionality for now is slightly compromised. I hope by the time I am being assessed, I would have pushed the code with Strapi as backend and Stripe for payment gateway to design a better more robust application.

For now the website is functional and responsive. The design is clean and minimal. Will continue adding features and commits to this project in future.
