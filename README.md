## [Live Preview](https://totalitycorp-frontend-challenge-liard-ten.vercel.app/)

This project was made using NextJS

I started with creating a nextJs application, version 13 was new and I read the documentation to understand routing better.

I used tailwind CSS to start with the design of my web-application. Personally I find it very simple and powerful.

Used headless CMS (Strapi in this case) to make the web-app not just front-end. 

The website is functional and responsive. The design is clean and minimal. Will continue adding features and commits to this project in future.
